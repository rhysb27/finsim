# finsim - Personal Financial Simulator

## Project Overview

Finsim is a configurable simulation which can help individuals or groups of people estimate how long it will take them to reach a given Savings target. Simulation data is provided via a `data.json` file in the project's root directory, allowing the simulation to be executed with just a couple of lines of code. The simulation will initially and periodically prompt the user to enter a "financial strategy" for each person included in the simulation, to allow fine-grained control over monthly savings deposits and debt repayments.
